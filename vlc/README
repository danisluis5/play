This project is clone of http://code.google.com/p/vlcj/

The main purpose of this clone is to provide flexible
way to work with native librarys.

Right now I add following features:

- building vlc library scripts

- packing vlc librarys into jar and installing it into local maven repo

- drop for annoying GPL console message

- fix version number to maven -SNAPSHOT prefix.
