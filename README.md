# play

Play - is a Java library to play Video / Music.

It would be based on VLC / QTMovie / gstreams.

Right now I'm testing VLC on all platroms, but if it fails. I will support platform dependent librarys.

Why another Java Video Library?

- VLCJ - windows library, never been tested on Mac and Linux platform. It is worth mentioning author do not care about support for library
users, unless you have paid subscription. Also I'm sure VLCJ will never be released under LGPL licence.
